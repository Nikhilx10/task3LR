# Linear Regression Implementation with Scikit-learn

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
A Python implementation of simple and multiple linear regression using Scikit-learn, Pandas, and Matplotlib. This project demonstrates:
Feature scaling with StandardScaler
Model evaluation using MSE and RÂ² scores
Visualization of regression lines and actual vs predicted values
clone the repository
Run the google colab notebook 
The implementation uses California housing data to predict median home values, comparing single-feature (AveRooms) and multi-feature approaches. 
Key components include standardized data scaling, MSE/RÂ² metric analysis, and intuitive plotting of regression lines and prediction comparisons.
